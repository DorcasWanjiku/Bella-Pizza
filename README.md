## Description
{This is my  own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen my customer base, i decided to create a web application where your customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings,they are also able to Choose the size of pizza they want e.g Small, Medium, Large
Choose what kind of crust they would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
Choose the topping(s) they want on my pizza.
Place an order for their Pizza and see the total charge for it.
Have an option to order as many pizzas as they want.
Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered they want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
If they want my pizza to be delivered, they want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.}
